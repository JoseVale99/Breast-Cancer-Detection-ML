# Breast Cancer Detection â€“ Machine Learning
In this project, we will build a simple machine learning model for breast cancer detection. This is a beginner friendly project, so if you are exploring sorting algorithms, this will help you understand them better.

## Problem Statement
Over the past decade, machine learning techniques have been widely used in intelligent health systems, particularly for breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis.  Breast Cancer is one of the most common cancers globally. So with the help of Machine Learning, we can build a model to classify the type of cancer, so it will be easy for doctors to provide treatment at the right time. Early diagnosis of breast cancer can dramatically improve prognosis and chances of survival, as it can promote timely clinical treatment of patients. 

### Importing the required Libraries
> As the first step, let us import the libraries required for the project. If you are not having these libraries, kindly install them using the following commands.

```bash
       $ pip install numpy
       $ pip install pandas
       $ pip install matplotlib
       $ pip install seaborn
       $ pip install sklearn
```
> dependencies for flask
```bash
       $ pip install virtualenv
```

### Virtual Environments
http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/

Example:

```
        pip install virtualenv
        cd my_project_folder
        virtualenv env
        source env/bin/activate
        pipenv install flask
        deactivate
```

### Start webapp:
```bash
        $ source env/bin/activate
        $ python run.py
        $ deactivate
```
